## User Stories
* As a shelter worker, I want to add animals to the system. An animal will have a name, gender, date of admittance, type (ex. cat/dog) and breed.
* As a shelter worker, I want to add a person as a customer into the system. A customer should have a name, phone, animal type preference, and a breed preference.
* As a potential owner, I want to see be able to see lists of animals by breed, type or by name alphabetically. (Hint: make separate pages for each of these, but write methods for these sorts)
* As a shelter worker, I want to list animals chronologically - starting with the ones who have been in the shelter the longest.
* As a shelter worker, I want to be able to see a list of customers by breed preference so if a specific breed arrives, I am able to contact potential owners for the animal.
* As a shelter worker, I want to add an owner to an animal if that customer adopts.
